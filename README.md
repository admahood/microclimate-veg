# Data and code for "Diurnal temperature range drives understory plant community composition in micro-climatically complex temperate montane forests"

## Study area

![](out/map_w_inset.png)


## Diurnal temperature range is stable

![](out/figure2_dtr_vc.png)

## DTR Drives fine-scale community composition and has a negative relationship with species richness
